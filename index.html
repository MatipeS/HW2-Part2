      <h1 class="underline">CSS Basics</h1>
      <p>CSS (<span class="bold underline">C</span>ascading <span class="bold underline">S</span>tyle <span class="bold underline">S</span>heets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do 
        I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do 
        I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?

      <h2 class="underline">What is CSS?</h2>
      <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. <strong>CSS is 
        a style sheet language</strong>. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. 
        For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:</p>
      <h2 class="underline" id="CSS-Anatomy-Heading">Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h2>
      Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works :
      <div>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png"
      Alt="Example of a ruleset"
      width="300"
      />
      </div>
      
      <p>The whole structure is called a <strong>ruleset</strong> (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.)Note the names of the individual parts:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>Selector</strong>- This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled</li>
      <li><strong>Declaration</strong>- This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</li>
      <li><strong>Properties</strong>- These are ways in which you can style an HTML element</li>
      <li><strong>Property Value</strong>- To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property.</li>
      <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
         <ul>
        <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
        <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
        <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
         </ul>
